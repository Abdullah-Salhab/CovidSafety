  "COVID-19 virus spread answer": "The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small droplets when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles can range in size from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols, and people can be contagious whether or not they are displaying symptoms.\n\nSo far, the evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nThe virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. Indoor locations, particularly those with poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations.\n\nPeople may also become infected by touching their mouth, nose or eyes after touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Experts are continuing their research into how COVID-19 spreads, and which situations are most risky.",

  "child be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine answer": "Before COVID-19 vaccines become available for younger children, clinical trials need to be completed. This is to ensure they are safe and effective for these age groups. Children are not little adults; we can't just assume a vaccine will have the same effect on a child as it does for someone older. Once this information is available, the AAP will review it and make vaccine recommendations for children and adolescents.",
